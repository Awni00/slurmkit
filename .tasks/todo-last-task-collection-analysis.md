Rough: when a job completes, check if it is the last job to complete in the collection (no jobs running or pending). If so, run an analysis and send to user in structured manner. The analysis can include `slurmkit collection analyze {...}`, but can also include an AI-directed analysis via an LLM tool (interface provided by user through python function for modularity). This report should provide the user with a high-level summary of the status of the job collection.
